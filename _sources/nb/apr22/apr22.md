Summary of progress in April 2022

- Emoprox2 full dataset:
    I got the full data of emoprox2 paradigm for the 300 ROI Schaefer parcellation, the MAX paradigmâ€™s 85 ROIs parcellation. 
    The paradigm stimulus was given as follows: each participant goes through 6 runs, each with 2 blocks of stimuli. A block may have shock events. So the data is naturally partitioned into continuous segments /windows between start of block to shock onset, shock offset to next shock onset, and shock offset to the end of the block. 
    I used these segments as my data samples. The data contains time series from all the ROIs - 300 or 85 depending on the parcellation.
    In order to incorporate hemodynamic lag in the fMRI responses w.r.t. to the stimulus, I selected time series by shifting each continuous segment by 2TRs and 3TRs.
    With these datasets I trained the GRU model, and checked whether their performances are above chance.

- **Observations from emoprox2 stimuli**. 
    1. This plot shows that the (canonical) fMRI response peaks at around 8.75TRs. And the information about the stimulus is present from around 5(or 6)TRs. So we should take segments of the fMRI signal shifted by 5(6)TRs from the onset of stimulus. 

    2. We also observe that the responses for the two classes (appr/ retr) oscillate. We can define a segment as time points between the intersections of the response curves. This is because at intersection influence of both the stimuli is similar, and at other time points one of them dominates. Thus such a segment would have least *contamination* from the other response.

    3. In addition to choosing such segments, we can introduce a third target label: **Don't care, or indistinguishable, or unidentifiable**. So the time points between intersections will belong to either of the two classes and the points around intersections will belong to the new third class.
